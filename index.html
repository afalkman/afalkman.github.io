<p>Yoenis Céspedes was born in the small town of Campechuela, Cuba. Céspedes debuted in the Cuban National Series with Granma during the 2003–04 season, and was runner up for the Rookie of the Year Award. He was the starting center fielder for Cuba in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, and led his team in RBI's, hits, and home runs. After Céspedes defected from Cuba in the summer of 2011, he became a legal resident of the U.S. in January of 2012. Céspedes bypassed the MLB draft and became an unrestricted free agent, and Kevin Goldstein of "Baseball Prospectus" said Céspedes was "arguably the best all-around player to come out of Cuba in a generation.</p>


<p>On March 28, 2012 Céspedes made in his major league debut with the Oakland Athletics, with the A's going on to win the American League West, and Céspedes batting .316 with a .381 OBP in the postseason that year. Céspedes won back to back Home Run Derby titles with the A's, becoming the first player to win consecutive Derby titles in MLB history. In 2014 Céspedes was traded to the Boston Red Sox, where he finished out the season playing in just 51 games. In the off season, Boston tradeed him to the Detroit Tigers where he won the Gold Glove Award in left field that following year, finishing with 9 assists and 11 Defensive Runs Saved.
	
<p>On July 31, 2015, Céspedes was traded to the New York Mets for 2 minor leaguers. In his first 41 games with the Mets, Céspedes was performing at an all time career high, hitting .309 with 17 home runs, 42 RBIs, and a .691 slugging percentage. Céspedes was awarded the NL Player of the Week Award for September 7 to the 13th where he batted .345, hit 4 home runs, scored 6 runs, and drove in 12 RBI's. His offensive explosion helped the Mets jump up to a 9 game lead over the Washington Nationals in the National League East. The Mets went on to win the Pennant, and took out both the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series, and the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series. Céspedes led the Mets all the way to the World Series, where the Mets were defeated by the Kansas City Royals. Céspedes became a free agent at the end of the season, but with hopes of another World Series run with the Mets, signed a 3-year, $75 million contract. As of today Céspedes is currently signed through the 2019 season, and the Mets have high hopes for 2018 to be the year they will see another World Series berth, with Céspedes leading them all the way there. </p>
